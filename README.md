# Introduction 
The "No Duplication" project is a simple web application that showcases the usage of the array.indexOf() method to detect duplicate names. The application maintains an array of names, and when a user enters a name in the input field and clicks the "Add Name" button, the application checks if the name is already present in the array. If the name is unique, it is added to the array and displayed on the page. If the name already exists in the array, the application alerts the user about the duplication.

## Usage
To use the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/no-duplication-demo.git
2. Open index.html in your web browser.
3. Enter a name in the input field.
4. Click the "Add Name" button.
5. If the name is unique, it will be added to the list. If the name already exists, the application will display an alert indicating the duplication.
